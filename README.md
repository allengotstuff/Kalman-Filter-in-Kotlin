# Kalman-Filter-in-Kotlin

A **Kalman Filter** implementation in **Kotlin**, designed with built-in support for **debugging, calibration, visualization**, and additional tools to enhance usability.

## 🚧 Under Active Development 🚧

This repository is actively under development, and its API, architecture, or functionality may change frequently. **Backward compatibility is not guaranteed**, and breaking changes may occur without prior notice.

If you're using this project, following closely with development updates. **Contributions and feedback are welcome!**

## 📌 What is a Kalman Filter?

A **Kalman Filter** is an algorithm that provides an **optimal estimate of an unknown variable** by iteratively refining predictions based on noisy sensor data. It is widely used in **robotics, tracking systems, navigation, and signal processing** due to its efficiency in filtering and predicting system states.

Specific use case of smartphone, including:
* GPS Positioning & Navigation
Problem: GPS signals are often noisy due to atmospheric interference, signal reflection, or loss in urban environments.
* Motion Tracking & Inertial Navigation (IMU Sensors)
  Problem: Smartphone accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers provide raw, noisy sensor readings.
* Camera Image Stabilization (OIS & EIS)
  Problem: Shaky hands cause unstable video recording and blurry photos.
* Touchscreen Smoothing & Gesture Recognition
  Problem: Raw touchscreen input contains noise, leading to shaky strokes in handwriting apps or inconsistent gestures.
* AR & VR of senor reading to predict state of system. 

Mobile Application:
Apps like Ski Tracks, Strava, and Runkeeper use Kalman filtering to smooth motion tracking and estimate accurate speed and position.

## 🔍 Why This Repository?

1. **Simplified Calibration** – Tuning a Kalman Filter requires extensive trial and error. This repository aims to provide **intuitive and extensive tools** for calibrating both **existing** and **new** multidimensional systems.
2. **Native Kotlin Support** – Unlike other implementations, this repository is built natively in **Kotlin**, offering seamless integration with the Kotlin ecosystem.
3. **Enhanced System Modeling Flexibility** – Traditional Kalman Filter implementations often assume fixed parameters per iteration. This implementation supports **dynamic covariance updates**, enabling more adaptable system modeling.

## 📂 Project Structure

### **Package Overview**
- **`org.kalman.core`** – The fundamental Kalman Filter implementation, designed with **detailed documentation** explaining its inner workings. This package offers **maximum flexibility** for system modeling and can be extended as needed.
- **`org.kalman.wrapper`** – A higher-level abstraction that wraps around `org.kalman.core` for common use cases on application layer.

## 🔢 Matrices and Vectors

The foundation of the Kalman Filter relies on **matrix and vector operations** for **multidimensional system modeling**. This implementation leverages **third-party libraries** for efficient computation.

Since **Kotlin lacks built-in matrix and vector operations**, this project uses:  
📌 [Apache Commons Math](https://github.com/apache/commons-math) – A **stable** and well-supported mathematical library.

## 📗 Usage & System Calibration

One of the **most valuable features** of this repository is **calibration support**.  
Using **native Kotlin tools and Kotlin Notebook**, this project enhances the **feedback loop and visualization** for debugging and fine-tuning the Kalman Filter.

### 🌟 **Key Benefits of the Calibration**  
* Example usage of Kalman filter in smaller dimension, to demystify kalman filter application. ✔
* Interactive debugging with real-time visual feedback. ✔  
* Faster iteration and parameter tuning. ✔
* Intuitive exploration of system behavior. ✔

### 📁  **Kotlin Notebook (`notebook/`)**
This folder contains **use cases, examples, and calibration tools** for the Kalman Filter. It serves as both:
- A **practical guide** to using the Kalman Filter with visualization.
- A **debugging and calibration tool**, allowing developers to interactively refine system parameters.

**Powered by Kotlin Notebook** – [Learn More](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/kotlin-notebook.html).  
This is one of the core features of the repository, providing **interactive debugging, visualization, and rapid iteration**.

Developers can:  
✅ Explore existing **examples and visualizations** through notebook.  
✅ Add new notebook for **calibration** and **custom system modeling** . (Contribution guideline are on the way)
